Handheld grass trimmers expose operators to high levels of multi-axial vibration due to engine excitation,
shaft imbalance, and structural resonance of the pipe assembly. Prolonged exposure can lead to discomfort
and health hazards under ISO 5349. This project aims to reduce handle vibration by designing and
implementing a multi-axial tuned vibration absorber (TVA) mounted near the handle region.
Experimental modal analysis was first performed on the trimmer pipe to identify dominant mode shapes and
resonant frequencies. A multi-axial absorber consisting of two orthogonal threaded rods and four end masses
was designed to target the critical resonance near 52 Hz, corresponding to major excitation from motor and
shaft rotation. Analytical tuning relations, stiffness estimation for 7 mm rods, and absorber-mass variation
studies were used to determine suitable absorber specifications. The absorber was fabricated and installed at
the experimentally determined node location.
Harmonic response simulations and FRF-based tuning confirmed the absorber’s effectiveness in splitting the
primary resonance and reducing peak amplitudes. Experimental validation showed substantial reductions in
weighted and unweighted RMS acceleration, with overall vibration reductions of 42–50% across the X, Y,
and Z axes. The results demonstrate that a compact, low-mass absorber (0.10 kg) can significantly mitigate
harmful vibrations without altering the trimmer’s primary structure.
The study highlights the applicability of tuned passive absorbers in portable power tools and provides a
framework for future optimization in absorber geometry, material selection, and adaptive tuning.
